# --- Purpose ---
# This script performs diagnostic checks on the school GIS data and display name mappings.
# 1. Loads the necessary shapefiles.
# 2. Extracts unique raw school identifiers from relevant columns.
# 3. Cross-checks these identifiers against the defined DISPLAY_NAMES_* dictionaries.
# It helps identify discrepancies like missing mappings or potential typos.
# Run directly using: python diagnostics.py

# --- Path Definitions ---
# Assumes this script is in the same directory as app.py was
